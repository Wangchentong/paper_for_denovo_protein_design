###  **Exploring evolution-based & -free protein language models as protein function predictors**  

Mingyang Hu & Fajie Yuan   [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06583) || 2022

intro: ***treat af2 evofomer as a language model since traning with bert-like msa mask, do lots of benchmarking with funtion prediction, structure prediction and zeroshot,
take out a view that evoformerblock is not SOTA for function task but esm-1b, which is not quite fair since different traning set. one curious is that why evofomer is so bad at zeroshot prediction?***
