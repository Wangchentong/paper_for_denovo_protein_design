# paper_for_denovo_protein_design
a paper list for denovo preotein design, incluede various field, some new progress and some classcial review, to help people who is newcomer for protein design

## About this repository

ths repo is not highly recommended for the latest progress in denovo design but mainly to introduce basic concept of it by list some classical and not too hard-reading paper, though we also list some new paper within it, i recommend that first read a few reviews and classical papers then jump into others. this repo will continuely update as soon as how often i read papers, every one is encouraged to edit this repo. the most important thing is i hope every paper in the list will be greate helpful to every new comer rather than very trival and uninovational.

### 1.1 **The coming of age of de novo protein design**  

Po-Ssu Huang, Scott E. Boyken & David Baker   [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature19946) || 2016

intro: ***author give a brief intro to denovo design, including physical principal and design strategy. A paper tell you what this field can do and what has been done. you can find a lot of progress here mainly made by traditional compuational design,notice that this paper published at 2016, when deep learning method hasn't show the great power but soon***  

### 1.2 **Recent advances in de novo protein design: Principles, methods, and applications**  

Xingjie Pan & Tanja Kortemme   [JBC Review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925821003367) || 2021

intro: ***this paper gives a systematic introduction to diffrent subfield or pipeline of denovo protein design: backbone generation,sequence design,scoring function. Also introduce different ways denovo protein perform function like binding ligand,self assemble,membrane proteins and dynamic proteins, more close to the mainstream research direction***
